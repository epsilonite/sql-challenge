# Pewlett Hackard Historic Employee Database
## Data Modeling
Existing data was provided to us in six csv files.<br>
These files were imported into a [Jupyter Notebook](chk_data.ipynb) in order to determine the contents of the data.<br>
By doing so we are able to determine datatypes and datatype lengths as relevant for each data set.<br>
as well as perform some data validation to determine how to assign restrictions for data engineering.

## Data Engineering

(Diagram above was created using QuickDBD)
### [Schemata](sql/schemas.sql)<br>
After looking at the data contained in the csv files and determining the data structure of each file,<br>
we used QuickDBD to quickly represent each data set and map out the relational structure between them,<br>
and figure out what columns we should assign the constraints primary key, foreign key, and unique.<br>
With that information, we were created the schemata in VScode to be imported into pgAdmin.

## Data Analysis
### [Queries](sql/queries.sql)
After creating a database in pgAdmin, we created tables using the schemata and imported each csv file<br>
into it's corresponding table in an appropriate order based on the relationships between each table.<br>
Once the database was setup, we were able to create queries to create the following lists:
- List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
- List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
- List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
- List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
- List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
- List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name)
