# Pewlett Hackard Historic Employee Database
This challenge has us as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard where we are tasked to do research into company employees during the 1980s and 1990s. We have access to six CSV files that are all that remaains of the emplyee database from that era, which we can use to attempt to reconstruct the missing database. Once the database is built, we can then design and accomplish our research.
